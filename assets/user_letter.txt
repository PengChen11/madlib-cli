Dear Mr. and Mrs. Pappa Lovepig,

Will you let me marry your dish washer? Ever since I have laid my eyes on your dish washer, I have terribly fall in love with her. I wish that she will be the precious green egg of my life and that someday we will stay together angrily ever after. I have a job as a/an shit burner at Iraq that pays $25 each month. I promise to treat your dish washer with kindness and respect.

Sincerely,
Stonehead Goodman
